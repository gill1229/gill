## 📐 What I Do

I sit at the intersection of **quantitative finance**, **venture capital**, and **data science** — building models that inform investment decisions and research that makes sense of messy markets.

Currently an **Investment Analyst Intern at Edge Ventures** ($2B+ AUM, deep tech VC), where I evaluate AI-driven industrial startups, stress-test revenue models, and reconstruct cap tables.

Previously at **Innoangel Fund**, where I sourced 20+ white-space opportunities in Embodied AI across APAC and supported a lead investment that returned **5× within 2 months**.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🏛 U.S. Treasury Yield Curve Methods *(Research, UChicago · 2024–Present)*
> Compared **6 yield curve construction pipelines** in Python with focus on Hermite polynomial interpolation. Performed time-series decomposition across **100 years** (1925–2025) of rate data to identify structural regimes and forward-rate patterns.

`Python` `pandas` `NumPy` `matplotlib` `Time-Series Analysis`

---

### 📊 Fama–French Factor Replication & China Adaptation *(CUHK-SZ · 2023)*
> Cleaned and standardized **110+ years** of U.S. equity data; implemented CAPM-based factor construction and adapted Fama–French–like alphas (ROE, profitability, net profit margin) to China's equity market. Evaluated cross-market model robustness.

`Python` `NumPy` `pandas` `Asset Pricing` `Factor Modeling`

---

### ⚡ A/B Testing Automation @ Ebao Technology *(InsurTech SaaS · 2023)*
> Built a Python pipeline automating financial metric calculations (CTR, CVR, CPA) across **~2M ad delivery records**. Reduced experiment turnaround from hours → **<20 minutes**. Identified 7 performance drivers that lifted conversion rate by **2.5%**.

`Python` `SQL` `Power BI` `Statistical Testing` `Marketing Analytics`

## 🌊 Outside the Terminal

When I'm not modeling cash flows or writing investment memos:

- 🎻 **Violoncello** — classical repertoire
- 🤿 **Free Diving** — chasing depth and silence
- 🍽 **Restaurant Curation** — mapping Michelin alternatives across cities
- 📷 **Photography** — documenting the in-between moments
